 * This class represents a two-dimensional level with a 2D grid of movement.
 * The details are very up to you. You can for instance layer up tiles to make more complex stuff if that is your cup of tea.
 * You can also add layered effects on top and what not. 
 * It's all up to you, which means that you have to keep the order of drawing in mind.
 * 
 * A square tile-based implementation comes with the engine as an example.
