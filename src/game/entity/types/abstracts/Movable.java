/**
 * A movable entity is a geographic entity that can change its positions.
 * If you tell it to move, this charmingly rustic mind will go there. Even if it isn't allowed.
 * Unlike the graphics engine which is slightly disobedient, this interface's charm comes from its blind obedience.
 * "Go on top of that lava!", you say, and then it goes on top of that lava.
 * You have great power over these entities, and with it comes great responsibility.
 * The implementing objects may not know anything about its levels.
 * In that case asking them if they can go somewhere is going to be slightly tricky, and you shouldn't trust them.
 * Don't accuse them of lying though. Their answers merely reflect their philosophical approach to logical truth:
 * If a statement is undecidable, and yet you must give a binary answer, what do you say?
 * True, because there is nothing saying it is not so?
 * False, because there is nothing saying it is so?
 * or a random answer, to teach people to not ask silly questions?
 * 
 * If you want useful answers, make sure that the implementing classes knows about their levels,
 * so that they may find their true selves and their place in the universe.
