 * A Geographic entity is any entity with X and Y coordinates in the tile world.
 * It doesn't have to be tickable (consider a movable block, or a pick-up, or something else), or paintable.
 * However, all things paintable are also Geographic, since the system needs to know where to paint it.
 * 
 * Note that in this system (0,0) is the top-left corner of the map.
