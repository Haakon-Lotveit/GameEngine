 * A paintable entity is anything that you want drawn by the graphics engine.
 * Since the graphics-engine is rather simple and not too bright,
 * it needs to be told in no uncertain terms where to paint the entity.
 * (If such a system was not implemented, everything would be drawn in the top-left corner of the canvas,
 *  and that would look absolutely mortifying.)
