# GameEngine
An English translation of the Kjips Kylling game engine. It also has a lot of cleanup.

## To-do list/Gjøremålsliste

  1. Make an easy to understand level format, that builds on the one used in Kjips Kylling
  2. Make an actual file system that describes campaigns, that extends massively on the system used in Kjips Kylling.
  3. Design and add in a system for sound. (TinySound seems promising.)
  4. Make a system for player movement.
  5. Make an example monster that can move around on a level in some capacity.
